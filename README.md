Greetings, fellow humans (and maybe some penguins)!

We, the mighty Polar Bear Clan, present to you our official Discord bot **Polar Chad**.

Get ready to unleash a wave of coolness upon your server with this feature-packed bot, built using the powerful
[Discord4j](https://discord4j.com/)
API.

Here's what Polar Chad brings to the party:

- **Greeting Command**: Because a warm welcome is always appreciated, even in the icy tundra.
- **Ping Command**: Test Polar Chad's reflexes and see if he's faster than a speeding penguin (probably not, but hey,
  it's
  fun!).
- **Joke Command**: Need a laugh? Polar Chad's got a stash of jokes that'll have you cracking up like a seal on nitrous
  oxide. (Okay, maybe not that strong, but still funny!)
- **Sus Command**: Ever get that feeling someone's acting a little... sus? Use this command to expose the imposters
  among
  you!
- **User Command**: Want to know more about yourself or a fellow server dweller? This command spills the beans (or
  should we
  say, fish?).
- **Server Command**: Get info about the server you're chilling in.
- **Fact Command**: Get the fact of the day
- **Waifu Command**: Onii chan!!!
- **Bear Command**: Just see how our fellows look like
- **Food Command**: Wanna eat something?

This is just the beginning for Polar Chad! We're constantly evolving and adding new features to make your Discord
experience even more epic.

If you're looking to contribute to a project that's both fun and functional, we want you on board!

Feel free to reach out to the [Polar Bear Clan](https://discord.gg/jStKjthr) for more info. Let's make Polar Chad the
ultimate Discord companion, together!
